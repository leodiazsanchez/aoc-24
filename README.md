# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄  

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I’ll be solving daily programming challenges using Java throughout December.  

## 🌟 About Advent of Code  
Advent of Code is an annual series of programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/). Each day from December 1st to 25th, a new problem is released, designed to challenge and delight programmers of all levels.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Here’s how the repository is organized:  
```plaintext  
├── src/  
│   ├── Day1/  
│   │   ├── input.txt          # Puzzle input for Day 1  
│   │   ├── part1.java         # Solution code for Day 1 (part1)
│   │   ├── part2.java         # Solution code for Day 1 (part2)
│   ├── Day2/  
│   │   ├── input.txt          # Puzzle input for Day 2  
│   │   ├── example.java       # Solution code for Day 2  
├── README.md                  # You are here!
├── out/                       # Compiled class files  
└── .gitignore                 # Git ignore rules  
```  

## 🛠️ How to Run  
To execute the solution for a specific day:  
1. Navigate to the appropriate day's directory under `src`.  
   ```bash  
   cd src/day01  
   ```  
2. Compile the solution file.  
   ```bash  
   javac src/Day1/part1.java  
   ```  
3. Run the program.  
   ```bash  
   java src/Day2/part1.java  
   ```
